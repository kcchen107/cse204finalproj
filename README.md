Intentional Aspects of Website Design:
1. Website intentionally has MORE diagrams, images, and designs and LESS text descriptions. Almost half of my consumer base is immigrants and immigrant families. Thus, I want to reduce the words and instead have diagrams, images, and designs that conveys the same information in a way that's easier to digest.
2. Only images have motion added to them. Information without images - such as the About Us, Program Types, and Packages sections - have no images so nothing in those sections have motion.
3. The page is responsive at any width > 375px.
